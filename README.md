Hi, I’m Colin. I currently work as a data analytics & business intelligence engineer. I mainly work within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. My goal is to use this space to showcase some of my technical skills, share some of my knowledge & experiences, and hopefully learn a few things along the way. 

You can reach me at ColinBarr25@gmail.com.

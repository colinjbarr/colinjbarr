Hi, I’m Colin. I currently work as a data analytics & business intelligence engineer. I mainly work within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. My goal is to learn a little bit of everything, and use this space (and my blog) to showcase some of my technical skills, hopefully learn a few things along the way. You can reach me at ColinBarr25@gmail.com.
